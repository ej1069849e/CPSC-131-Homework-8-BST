# CPSC-131-Homework-8-BST

You have to write recursive implementations for each of the problems below.  
To code recursive implementation for each problem, you will actually write 2 functions, one regular, another recursive helper.


* #1	 Find the sum of nodes in a Binary Search Tree [5 points]
* #2	 Find the sum of leaves in a Binary Search Tree [5 points]
* #3	 Print the nodes in descending order in a Binary Search Tree [5 points]
 Note: When it says nodes in the above, it means the nodesâ€™ data which is really the keys. 
 Because for simplicity, we are only storing a key at each node.
